# Python GUI Password Checker

A simple Python GUI app using Tkinter that checks password strength.  
It shows errors in red if the password doesn’t meet rules and a green “Strong password!” message when it’s valid.
I made 2 versions,the first hides your input as it is typed,while the second shows it.
